Connor Owens

Software Enginner and Fashion Designer

I just recently graduated with my bachelors degree in Computer Science this May, and am looking for a position in Software Engineering. I am interested in Full Stack development, Front End, Databases, Data Science and though do not have much experience find machine learning very intersting.
